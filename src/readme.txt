This project implements an accelerated version of t-SNE, in an interactive GUI environment. 
This version of tSNE works as follows:
Both the neighbourhoods in high-dimension (HD) and lower-dimension (LD) are estimated though the iterations. The tSNE iterations are performed alongside the neighbourhood estimation, using the approximated sets.

There are 4 main threads by essence:
1/ A neighbourhood discovery thread for HD  neighbours.
2/ A neighbourhood discovery thread for LD  neighbours.
3/ A tSNE optimisation thread which:
	- subdivides into smaller CPU threads, cutting sum(i<N) into chunks.
	- sends the gradient computation to the GPU using CUDA
4/ A GUI thread which can modify values stored inside the other threads according to user inputs, and shows Xld on screen.

GUI:  with SDL2
CUDA on the algorithm: optional
